How Node JS differs from Vanilla JS
1. Node runs on a server- not in a browser(backend not frontend)
2.The console is the terminal window
3.global object instead of window object
global object is smaller but has same property as windows object have
4.Has common Core modules that we will explore - like os modules, file modules
5.CommanJS modules instead of ES6 modules
to import instead of using import "as" from "" (ES6)
we write require("") (CommanJS)
node filename.js
6.Missing some JS API's like fetch
